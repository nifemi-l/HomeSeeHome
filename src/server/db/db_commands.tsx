/**
 * PROLOGUE
 * File name: db_commands.tsx
 * Description: Handles database connectivity and defines functions for inserting, updating, and retrieving data from the PostgreSQL database.
 * Programmer: Delroy Wright
 * Creation date: 3/2/26
 * Preconditions: Environment variables for database credentials are defined in .env; PostgreSQL database is running and accessible.
 * Postconditions: A database connection is established and utility functions are available for performing CRUD operations on Household, Account, Feature, and Task relations.
 * Errors: Database connection may fail due to invalid credentials, unreachable host, or server-side errors; SQL execution errors may occur if schema constraints are violated.
 * Side effects: Opens a persistent database connection pool; utility functions perform async SQL operations.
 * Invariants: SQL statements use parameterized queries to prevent injection.
